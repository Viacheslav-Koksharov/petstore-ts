            "question": "How much cooked pork meat can a dog eat?",
            "answer": "That depends on the size of the dog. Only pork meat is not a balanced meal and should be combined with organs, vegetables, seeds and if necessary, certain supplements to reach nutrient requirements. PetCubes includes pork meat and organs with beneficial plants to provide optimized nutrient concentrations."
